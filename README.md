# APA-Sample-Projects

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the sample projects using the main `index.js` file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your Codespace. You can check the versions by running:
```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

## Installation

Install the dependencies for the main project:
```sh
npm install
```

## Running the Project

Start the main menu script:
```sh
npm start
```

You will see a menu in the terminal where you can use the arrow keys to navigate through the list of subprojects.

1. Select a project to manage by pressing `Enter`.
2. You will be prompted to install dependencies for the selected project. Choose `yes` or `no` and press `Enter`.
3. The script will then start the selected project. If you selected `JestSuperTest`, it will run the tests instead of starting the server.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the menu:

1. Start the main menu script:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
2. Use the arrow keys to select `SinglePageApp` and press `Enter`.
3. When prompted, choose `yes` to install dependencies and press `Enter`.
4. The script will install the dependencies and start the `SinglePageApp` project.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the running application.

Repeat the steps to manage other subprojects as needed.

Enjoy exploring the sample projects!
